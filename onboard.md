## Processes


### Contributing

You should:
  - Run tests and lints locally before pushing to a remote repository.
  - Use pull requests to contribute code to master.
  - Add any relevant peers as a 'Reviewer' of the PR.

You should not:
  - Push directly to master or prod.
  - Push code without working tests.

Don't forget to maintain work/life balance :)

### Git Branch, Commit, PR messaging

You should:
  - Prepend your branch name with your initials (jm/onboarding-doc).
  - Squash PRs with a large number of commits.
  - Use descriptive commit messages and branch names.
  - Include a descriptive PR message for the reviewer

You should not:
  - Assume the reviewer has previous knowledge of the code you're pushing.
  - Assume the reviewer has time to decrypt your PR message into something that makes sense.
