## Processes


### Contributing

You should:
  - Run tests and lints locally before pushing to a remote repository.
  - Use pull requests to contribute code to master.
  - Add any relevant peers as a 'Reviewer' of the PR.

You should not:
  - Push directly to master or prod.
  - Push code without working tests.

Don't forget to maintain work/life balance :)
